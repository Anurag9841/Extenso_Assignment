# PySpark Projects

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of projects demonstrating the use of PySpark for various data engineering and data processing tasks. Each project highlights different aspects of PySpark, including basic and intermediate operations, data transfer between systems, streaming data processing, and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows.

## Table of Contents

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Project Structure](#project-structure)
- [Projects](#projects)
  - [PySpark Tutorial](#pyspark-tutorial)
  - [SQL to Hadoop File Transfer](#sql-to-hadoop-file-transfer)
  - [Kafka Streaming](#kafka-streaming)
  - [ETL Layout](#etl-layout)

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
- [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
- [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pyspark kafka-python
```

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following directories:

- `Pyspark_tut/`: Contains notebooks and scripts for basic and intermediate PySpark practices.
- `Sql_to_hadoop_file_transfer/`: Contains scripts for transferring data from SQL to Hadoop.
- `Kafka_Streaming/`: Contains separate scripts for Kafka producer and consumer using PySpark.
- `ETL_layout/`: Contains scripts and notebooks for an ETL workflow using PySpark.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Projects

### PySpark Tutorial

**Directory**: `Pyspark_tut/`

This project includes various notebooks and scripts that cover the basics and intermediate concepts of PySpark. It is an excellent starting point for anyone new to PySpark, providing hands-on practice with DataFrames, RDDs, and various transformations and actions.

### SQL to Hadoop File Transfer

**Directory**: `Sql_to_hadoop_file_transfer/`

This project demonstrates how to transfer data from a SQL database to the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) using PySpark. The scripts showcase connecting to a SQL database, reading data into a PySpark DataFrame, and writing the data to HDFS.

### Kafka Streaming

**Directory**: `Kafka_Streaming/`

This project involves building a Kafka streaming application using PySpark. It contains separate scripts for the Kafka producer and consumer, demonstrating how to produce data to a Kafka topic and consume data from it in real-time using PySpark.

### ETL Layout

**Directory**: `ETL_layout/`

This project illustrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow using PySpark. The scripts and notebooks guide you through extracting data from various sources, transforming the data using PySpark transformations, and loading the processed data into a target system.
