# Delta Lake Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and upserts in Delta Lake using PySpark. Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions to Apache Spark and big data workloads. This project showcases the capabilities of Delta Lake in managing large datasets efficiently and reliably.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
- [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
- [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/)

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pyspark delta-spark
```

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files and directories:

- `data/`: Directory containing sample datasets.
- `Delta_Lake.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing PySpark code for CRUD operations and upserts.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Usage

All CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and upserts are performed in a single Jupyter notebook called `Delta_Lake.ipynb`. This notebook contains the necessary PySpark code to demonstrate how to manage data in Delta Lake.

To get started, open the `Delta_Lake.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions within to perform the following operations:

- **Insert Data**: Instructions and code to insert data into a Delta Lake table.
- **Update Data**: Instructions and code to update data in a Delta Lake table.
- **Delete Data**: Instructions and code to delete data from a Delta Lake table.
- **Upsert Data**: Instructions and code to upsert (insert or update) data in a Delta Lake table.
